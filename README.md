# Handshake Jammers meeting minutes

The dWeb Foundation hosts bi-weekly jam sessions to coordinate amongst active Handshake contributors working on various projects necessary for Handshake adoption. These calls are publicly auditable via this repository as well as joinable upon request. The members of the Foundation reserve the right to restrict invitees to these calls to reduce noise and to work as effectively as possible, since these meetings are used to optimize for productivity and for its members to leave each meeting with concrete actionables.
